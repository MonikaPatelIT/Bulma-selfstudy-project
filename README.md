# What is Bulma ?

Well, It is an open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and used by more than 100,000 developers.

You can get more details about it from it's official website [https://bulma.io](https://bulma.io)

There are couple of articles and courses available to get into it. 

## Why am I doing this?
No solid reason except people saying in their tweets Bulma is better then Bootstrap and I wanted to know what is really better then Bootstrap.
I have been obssessed with bootstrap so much never think of using anything else but as a part of developer roadmap and awesome courses on [Scriba](https://scrimba.com) by Zaydek and Per thought why not at least check it out and add it to my bucket list.
